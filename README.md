Gallic-Wars
===========

Repo specificially for the Gallic Wars Trigger-based map

Rough Idea:
This map features 3 stages:

1. Discovery of the Romans. Readying defenses (maybe with tasks like build outposts / towers on that and that spot, research this and that tech etc. etc.).

2. Defend the Village from the Roman attacks. (but for the sake of surprise not on fixed intervals). Large attacks with Siege Rams would come over the Main road (maybe state that these Romans come from Condatum where skilled Roman Siege Engineers live.) Small attacks would come using the small paths in the forest with attacking of the possible resource gatherers in the forest.

3. Counterattack. Kill the Roman Centurion. Save the Druid quest. Other events (like Phoenician Trader, maybe Pirate Landings) and sub-tasks.
